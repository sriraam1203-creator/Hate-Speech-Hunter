Hate Speech Hunter

Tamil Hate Speech Detection using IndicBERT

 Overview:

Hate Speech Hunter is an NLP-based system designed to detect hateful and offensive comments in Tamil language social media text. With the rapid growth of online platforms, manual moderation has become inefficient. This project automates hate speech detection using IndicBERT, a transformer model optimized for Indian languages.

 Problem Statement:

Most existing hate speech detection systems focus on English and fail to capture:

Tamil linguistic structure

Cultural and contextual nuances

Misspellings, special characters, and informal text

This project aims to build a Tamil-specific hate speech detection model that is more accurate and context-aware.

Objectives:

Detect hate speech in Tamil text automatically

Handle noisy and poorly written social media content

Compare multiple ML models and identify the best performer

Improve moderation efficiency for social platforms

 Methodology:

Text preprocessing (stopword removal, normalization)

Feature extraction using IndicBERT embeddings

Classification using:

Naive Bayes

SVM

Logistic Regression

KNN

Random Forest

Performance evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

Results:

Random Forest achieved the best performance

Accuracy up to 81%

IndicBERT significantly outperformed traditional TF-IDF approaches

Tamil-specific embeddings improved contextual understanding
